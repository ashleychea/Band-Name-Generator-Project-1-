# Band-Name-Generator-Project-1- by Ashley Chea done in Python

- The purpose of this project was to use functions such as "print" and "input" to generate a New Band Name based on the city you grew up in and the name of the pet you had when growing up.

- You'll start with a standard print function for a greeting which will welcome the user to the project
ex.) print("Hello and Welcome to the Band Name Generator")

- On the next line you would introduce the system to the input function. The input () function is a "prompt for the user" which tells the user what exactly you want them to do given the information they will receive. 
Along with the input function you want to implement the new line function (\n) which will direct the answer of the input to a new line for better visability for the user and those reading the code afterwards.
ex.) city = input("What city did you grow up in?\n")
ex.) pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

- Finally, you want to combine your lines of code to execute exactly what you want 
ex.) print("Your new band name is" + city + " " + pet)
This will execute exactly what you want which is a new band name. Give it a try and let me know how it went for you.
